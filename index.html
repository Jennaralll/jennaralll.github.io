		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Jenna, and am a rising junior at Lowell High School. I love watching k-dramas and t.v shows such as American Horror Story and Once Upon a Time in my free-time, along with drawing, listening to k-pop, and playing MOBAs online. I play badminton and dragonboat on the weekends and afterschool. I'm the president of a club at my school called P.A.W.S, and our main purpose is to provide for animals without shelter, which is what the acronym stands for. I will be taking AP Computer Science in the fall semester. I hope to learn new things this summer that may benefit or aid in my future courses. Through Girls Who Code, I have made many connections, as well as getting to create new programs and making them run, making my whole summer experience 110% better! </p>

		<h3>Square</h3>

		<p>In this program, we programmed our sprite to move with a pen to create a square. Finishing early, and seeing that we were nearing july 4th, I created two squares and repeated it three times for each different color (red and blue) so that it resembled fireworks displayed during the Independence Day. </p>

		<p> For this program, we worked in partners and created a Disney-based adventure. My partner and I researched online for map of Disneyland California Adventure Park, and navigated through the map for the beginning to end for a planned escape route. </p>

		<h3>Snow Animation</h3>
		<img src = "images/Snow_Animation.jpg" width ="400" height = "300" alt ="Scratch_Square.jpg">
		<p> In pairs, we created an animation of falling snow. Taking into perspective the constantly changing y axis of this program, as well as the x position for which each snow object spawns, we succesfully created the animation with a struggles here and there. As a stretch challenge, we had to add a background, which we imported from Google images and used our online resources efficiently to learn how to add it in. </p>
